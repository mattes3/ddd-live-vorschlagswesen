# Rule: Generating a Task List from a PRD

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in creating a detailed, step-by-step task list in Markdown format based on an existing Product Requirements Document (PRD). The task list should guide a developer through implementation.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown (`.md`)
- **Location:** `/tasks/`
- **Filename:** `tasks-[prd-file-name].md` (e.g., `tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`)

## Process

1.  **Receive PRD Reference:** The user points the AI to a specific PRD file
2.  **Analyze PRD:** The AI reads and analyzes the functional requirements, user stories, and other sections of the specified PRD.
3.  **Phase 1: Generate Parent Tasks:** Based on the PRD analysis, create the file and generate the main, high-level tasks required to implement the feature. Use your judgement on how many high-level tasks to use. It's likely to be about 5. Present these tasks to the user in the specified format (without sub-tasks yet). Inform the user: "I have generated the high-level tasks based on the PRD. Ready to generate the sub-tasks? Respond with 'Go' to proceed."
4.  **Wait for Confirmation:** Pause and wait for the user to respond with "Go".
5.  **Phase 2: Generate Sub-Tasks:** Once the user confirms, break down each parent task into smaller, actionable sub-tasks necessary to complete the parent task. Ensure sub-tasks logically follow from the parent task and cover the implementation details implied by the PRD.
6.  **Identify Relevant Files:** Based on the tasks and PRD, identify potential files that will need to be created or modified. List these under the `Relevant Files` section, including corresponding test files if applicable.
7.  **Generate Final Output:** Combine the parent tasks, sub-tasks, relevant files, and notes into the final Markdown structure.
8.  **Save Task List:** Save the generated document in the `/tasks/` directory with the filename `tasks-[prd-file-name].md`, where `[prd-file-name]` matches the base name of the input PRD file (e.g., if the input was `prd-user-profile-editing.md`, the output is `tasks-prd-user-profile-editing.md`).
9. Do NOT implement any task at all, until the user tells you so!

## Output Format

The domain logic goes into subpackages that reside under `packages/domainlogic`.

The web UI and its request handlers go into subpackages that reside under `packages/containers` (they are called "containers" because each one runs a stand-alone web server that serves the requests for a particular parent URL).

The containers always have a `backend` and a `frontend` folder. Under those folders, there is a `src` folder for the sources, and a `test` folder for the unit tests. This applies to frontend as well as backend.

The generated task list _must_ follow this structure:

```markdown
## Relevant Files

- `src/path/to/potential/file1.ts` - Brief description of why this file is relevant (e.g., Contains the main component for this feature).
- `test/path/to/file1.test.ts` - Unit tests for `file1.ts`.
- `src/path/to/another/file.ts` - Brief description (e.g., web request handler for data submission).
- `test/path/to/another/file.test.ts` - Unit tests for `another/file.ts`.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed in the `test` folder next to the `src` folder that is a parent for the code files they are testing (e.g., `src/path/to/mycomponent.ts` and `test/path/to/mycomponent.test.ts`).
- Use `vitest` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the vite configuration.

## Tasks

- [ ] 1.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 1.1 [Sub-task description 1.1]
  - [ ] 1.2 [Sub-task description 1.2]
- [ ] 2.0 Parent Task Title
  - [ ] 2.1 [Sub-task description 2.1]
- [ ] 3.0 Parent Task Title (may not require sub-tasks if purely structural or configuration)
```

## Interaction Model

The process explicitly requires a pause after generating parent tasks to get user confirmation ("Go") before proceeding to generate the detailed sub-tasks. This ensures the high-level plan aligns with user expectations before diving into details. Even when you get a "Go" from the user, avoid implementation of any tasks until the user asks you to implement a task with a particular number!

## Target Audience

Assume the primary reader of the task list is a **junior developer** who will implement the feature.
