# Project Brief

## Project Name
ddd-live-vorschlagswesen

## Description
A monorepo containing a demo example for Matthias Bohlen's weekly livestream "DDD Live". It is a web-based application that manages "Vorschläge", i.e. proposals for business process improvement, made by employees of a fictitious company.

## Author
Matthias Bohlen

## License
AGPL 3.0

## Core Purpose
The web app shall demonstrate the correct use of Domain-Driven Design in code, using typical Domain-Driven Design (DDD) components including entities, value objects, repositories, and domain services. It uses ddd-scaffolder, an MCP server that generates DDD components, also written by Matthias Bohlen.

## Key Features
- Submit proposal
- Accept proposal
- Reject proposal
- Postpone proposal

## Target Users
Students of the Domain-Driven Design classes given by Matthias Bohlen who want to get a good understand what the code for an app looks like that was developed using the DDD methodology.

## Success Criteria
- The web application fully implements the key features (submit proposal, accept proposal, reject proposal, postpone proposal) using correct DDD patterns, including entities, value objects, repositories, and domain services.
- Students attending the Domain-Driven Design classes can successfully run the application, explore the codebase, and gain a clear understanding of how DDD principles are applied in practice.
- The code serves as an effective educational example, demonstrating best practices in DDD implementation for web applications.
- The application is successfully used in the weekly "DDD Live" livestream to illustrate DDD concepts in real-time development.

## Constraints
- The application must strictly adhere to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) methodology, utilizing components such as entities, value objects, repositories, and domain services as specified.
- Development must occur within a monorepo structure using TypeScript, managed with pnpm and Turbo for build orchestration.
- The ddd-scaffolder MCP server, developed by Matthias Bohlen, must be used for generating DDD components to ensure consistency and automation.
- The application must be web-based and support the management of proposals (Vorschläge) in a fictitious company context.
- All domain-related code and user-facing elements must be in German to match the business domain.
- The project must be licensed under AGPL 3.0.
- Development must align with the weekly livestream schedule, allowing for iterative, live coding sessions.

## Notes
- Currently, there is no additional context or important information here.
